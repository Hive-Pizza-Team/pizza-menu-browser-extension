Browser extension providing a menu of Hive apps

Hive is much bigger than you think! Hive has so much to offer, so here's a menu of useful stuff to try out.

The Pizza Menu extension is geared towards new Hivers. It helps with discovery and quick reference for the many web apps outside of Hive.blog. It is a collection of shortcuts to useful Hive blockchain web apps. As the explosion of Hive blockchain app development continues, new apps will be added to the menu.

The Pizza Menu includes several apps which require authentication. This extension pairs well with the Hive Keychain extension.
